S3	Ensure all data in AWS S3 has been discovered, classified and secured when required	Security	High	Recommendation: Recommendation: Implement AWS S3 data discovery and classification policies, along with encryption, access control, and monitoring to ensure that all S3 data is properly classified and secured. Fix Steps: Data Discovery:  Enable Amazon Macie to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in S3. Macie uses machine learning to discover and classify sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII). Enable AWS Config to track changes in the S3 buckets and ensure that data classification is updated as required. Data Classification:  Use S3 Object Tags and S3 Inventory reports to classify data according to business needs. Tags can be used to categorize S3 objects based on the content, sensitivity, or other criteria. Ensure that Macie or custom solutions are used to classify data based on predefined rules for sensitive data (e.g., PII, PCI). Securing Data:  Enable S3 Bucket Encryption using AWS KMS (Key Management Service) to automatically encrypt data at rest. Implement S3 Block Public Access to restrict public access to your S3 buckets and objects, preventing unintended exposure. Use IAM policies and S3 access control lists (ACLs) to enforce least privilege access to S3 data. Enable S3 Versioning to keep track of object changes and maintain data integrity. Implement AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log all S3 bucket access requests for auditing and security. Ongoing Monitoring:  Continuously monitor your S3 buckets using Amazon GuardDuty for unusual access patterns or malicious activities. Configure AWS CloudWatch to set alarms based on specific S3 activity (e.g., access from unusual locations).
